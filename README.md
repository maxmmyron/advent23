these are my personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles. i'm starting off with using [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for the solutions, but i might switch to another language later on.

each day includes my solution to both parts of the puzzle, as well as a detailed explanation of my thought process and the overall implementation.

fair warning, these implementations are not promised to be the most efficient or the most elegant. in other words, they suck. but, AoC is always a fun way to learn something new, and it's the perfect excuse to finally learn rust.
